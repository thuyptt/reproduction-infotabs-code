<p>In this task, we will ask you to make inferences about information presented in a tabular form.</p>

<p>We will show you a table. Using only the table and what you believe <i>most</i> people know about the world, you should write:</p>

<ol>
	<li>One statement that is definitely true,</li>
	<li>One statement that may or may not be true, and</li>
	<li>One statement that is definitely false.</li>
</ol>

<!--<p>&nbsp;</p>-->

<p>Things to keep in mind as you write these statements. The examples below expand on these points :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid using information that you may know, if you believe that it is not generally known.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't use names of people or places not mentioned in the table for writing your statements. Also, don't refer to outside sources of information.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Write sentences which would require some inference instead of literally restating information from the tables. </li>
	<ul>
		<li>Please avoid writing trivially false statements that simply contradict information in the table, or make minor changes to numerical values in the table.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Your sentences should be self-contained. That is, even if the table were to be removed from the page, your sentences should make sense.</li>
	<li>Try to use information from different parts of the table in crafting your sentences.</li>
	<li>Don't use subjective reasoning or using your personal opinion to create the "may be true" sentences.</li>
	<li>Please write grammatically correct and complete sentences.</li>
</ul>
